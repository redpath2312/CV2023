    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>An experienced and trusted qualified Agile Project Manager now looking to broaden my skills and
          transition into a development role. I have a proven track record of leading a variety
          of complex high value, regulatory projects that drive organisational transformation and growth. 
        This has involved working with many different people of different roles across multiple teams and divisions
    in the business which is now in a well established hybrid environment.</p>
    <p>I have become passionate about tech and metaverse innovation resulting in recent side projects that have blended delivery and development. 
        I've been able to help create new prototypes for cutting edge features whilst managing the delivery side of working towards specific milestones meaning
        it can get the internal visibility and opportunity for awareness and support.        
    </p>
    <p>I have been learning C# and Unity for the past year which has helped fuel my personal interest in Game Development resulting in some minigame prototypes and now looking
     at complementing this with Web Development.</p>
