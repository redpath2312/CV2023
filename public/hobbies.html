<h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>I try to stay active and as well as trying to go to the gym, I particularly enjoy playing football and Padel Tennis.</p>
    <h2>Game Development</h2>
    <p>I started learning about Game Development as a hobby and am continuing to learn and practice by taking various courses, tutorials and building prototypes. I am a creative person with a background in music creation, and would like to incorporate this more into my game development journey too.</p>
    <h2>Social</h2>
    <p>I enjoy getting out and doing things like cinema, concerts, the odd walks, theme parks, and even plan on learning sailing later in the year.</p>
